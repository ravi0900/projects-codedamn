 In this step you have to add some discription and class ref for li tag to page 

use ref code like this

```li ref
    <section class="section about" id="about">
    <div class="title">
      <h1>About me</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="right" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="2000">
        <h1>I'm Ravi and a <span id="type2"></span></h1>
        <p>
         lorem.
        </p>
    ```

The text can be fill with lorem or you can write something on you own.
Use color as you like Color is default in cdn and make custom style.css file, next step is in detail for this.
