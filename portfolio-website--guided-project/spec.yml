short-description: Build a portfolio website using the HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
long-description: |
  Your challenge is to build out this portfolio page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
  
  This project focuses mostly on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There's a tiny bit of JS for easy text animation and custom nav bar and layout animation.!
  
  You can use any tools you like to help you complete the project. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
  
  Your users should be able to:
  
  - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
  
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  
  Download the starter code and go through the `README.md` file. This will provide further details about the project. The `style-guide.md` file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
