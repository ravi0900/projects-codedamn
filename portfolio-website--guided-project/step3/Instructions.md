In this step you have to make sure that the landing page is responsive across all major resolution breakpoints. 

The following are the common breakpoints used in css : 

  
html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-size: 62.5%;
}

body {
  font-family: "Poppins", sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.6rem;
  font-weight: 400;
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #000;
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

You can adjust the resolution of the landing page using the dev tools to test out your page looks across different resolutions.
